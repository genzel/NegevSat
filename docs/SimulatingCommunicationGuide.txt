Simulating communication guide:

1. Download and install VSPE software (Virtual Serial Ports Emulator)
2. Download and install TeraTerm (For tests)
3. On server (airborne system) configure virtual COM1 port and then TCP server listening on that port (using VSPE)
4. On clients (ground station and simulator) configure virtual COM1 port and then TCP client listening to the server ip and port (usually 5555)
5. Configure TSIM2 in debug configuration -> edit -> extra options with -fast_uart flag (EXTRA IMPORTANT! WITHOUT THIS FLAG THE DATA WILL GET LOST)
